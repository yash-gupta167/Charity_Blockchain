# Charity Blockchain Project

### Problem Statement
- There are no platforms that can be used by charities to ensure security while providing accessibility to maximum people.
- The biggest problem faced is transparency, where people can rightly exercise their Right To Information by asking for a record of expenditure by the charity
- Even if such applications are available, they are inaccessible to smaller organisations with a good user interface for ease of access.

### Requirements of the Project
 - **Solidity Web3**
	* Solidity provides Inheritance properties in contracts including multiple level inheritance properties.
 - **Metamask**
	* To have an easy-to-use and secure wallet service, the platform connects to users' MetaMask automatically.
 - **Node.js**
	* Node.js is used a backend for our application. It records transactions communicates between the Applications and integrates frontend.
 - **Ganache**
	* Ganache provides the GUI-based local Ethereum blockchain development environment to deploy and test contracts.

### Project Working
* A metamask connection is required to run the application for any transaction.
* A ganache RPC Server is run with metamask as the wallet, using the node.js interface.
* Charity and organisation details are saved in the application, and a hash value is generated
* A transaction is carried out, between organisation and charity and transaction hash is generated for each transaction
* A block is created, when the user mines all the transactions updates.
